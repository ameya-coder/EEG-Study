        <h1>NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY CALICUT</h1>
        <h2>Participation Information Sheet</h2>
        <p>This informed consent form is for participants from the student community of NIT Calicut who we are inviting to participate in an experiment for the research, titled:</p>
        <h3>A Framework for assessing spatial perception of human psychological comfort in urban spaces.</h3>
        <p><strong>Investigators:</strong> Lakshmi Manohar and Dr. Chithra K</p>
        <p><strong>Associating Institute:</strong> National Institute of Technology Calicut, Kerala</p>
        <h3>1. What is the purpose of this research?</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to explore neurological responses while experiencing different urban environments through immersive VR.</p>
        <h3>2. What does my participation involve?</h3>
        <p>This research project will require you to participate in our study as you experience different streets of various cities. The study will require you to wear a VR headset and a mobile EEG device for not more than 20 minutes to record your brain activity as you experience 360-degree videos of various types of urban spaces through a fully immersive VR headset.</p>

            <p>There will be an initial setup process, which may take a few minutes before the experiment begins. While recording your EEG, the study may require you to fill out some questionnaires and complete tasks as instructed by the principal investigator.</p>
            
            <p>A photograph of the volunteer wearing the device will be taken for academic purposes. The experiment may be video recorded as well.</p>
            
            <p>The participant is not allowed to wear any headgear (scarfs, caps, hats, wigs, etc.) or any metal hair clips or electronic devices during the course of the experiment.</p>
        <h3>3. Do I have to take part in this research project?</h3>
        <p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You should read this consent form carefully to understand the requirements and risks of this specific study. Once you have decided to continue and sign the consent page, you are stating that you have read and understood the project.</p>
        <h3>4. What are the possible risks of taking part?</h3>
        <p>The EEG headset used in this experiment is a non-invasive device, and the sensors are moistened with saline solution (in the case of the Insight Headset, glycerine is also used). Both the EEG headset and VR headset, when fitted together, may feel tight and can sometimes cause slight pain related to tightness when worn for long periods.</p>

            <p>This experiment does not contain any stimuli that could be emotionally distressing. If you feel distressed or concerned, you may request the investigator to stop the experiment.</p>
        <h3>5. What are the benefits of taking part in this research?</h3>
        <p>There will be no direct benefit to you, but your participation is likely to help us find out more about how to design urban spaces that are psychologically comfortable, leading to policies for planning and development of cities with stress-free urban environments. You will not be provided any incentive to take part in the research.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Is my data identifiable?</h3>
        <p>Your data will be anonymous. Data generated by the mobile EEG device will be used only for academic purposes. To protect your identity, you will be assigned a numeric identifier, which will be shared with the researcher and linked to your EEG data and any survey questions asked specifically during this study.</p>
        <h3>7. Further information</h3>
        <p>If you would like any further information concerning this project, you may contact the Investigator at:</p>
        <p>This proposal has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of National Institute of Technology Calicut, which ensures that research participants are protected from harm.
